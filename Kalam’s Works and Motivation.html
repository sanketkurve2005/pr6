    <h2>He was the writer of various motivational books like "India 2010", "Touched off Minds", "Mission India", "The Luminous Sparks", "Wings of Fire", and "Moving Thoughts".

    His life, work, and convictions are loaded up with models and motivations. He will keep on inspiring us for eternity. Furthermore, this is the genuine justification for why individuals from every one of the segments of the general public precipitously show love for this incredible person on his miserable end at IIM Shillong on 27th July 2015.
        
     May this Noble and faithful Soul find happiness in the hereafter!    </h2>
